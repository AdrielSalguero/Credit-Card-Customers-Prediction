In order to enhance my machine learning skills, I have been working on various projects. The dataset you will see below has been obtained from the Kaggle platform. Its context is as follows:

      A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate 
      if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services 
      and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.
            
      I got this dataset from a website with the URL as https://leaps.analyttica.com/home. I have been using this for a while to get 
      datasets and accordingly work on them to produce fruitful results. The site explains how to solve a particular business problem.
            
      Now, this dataset consists of 10,000 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card, 
      etc. There are nearly 18 features.
            
      We have only 16.07% of customers who have churned.
